# rapidus-examples

A demo application written in literate coffeescript that does logging right
using rapidus. It works with `cluster`, adds an identifier to group messages
belonging to the same request and it has pretty colours for the output going to
the terminal.

The [main script](example.litcoffee) has more information on how to get setup.
It's also available in [plain javascript](example.js) without the documentation
and nice coffeescript syntax.

Also check out the [configuration file](config/default.yaml) that holds the
runtime configurable bits in a YAML.
